Urban centers are increasingly challenged by rising crime rates, making public safety a major concern. Yet, discovering valuable insights from crime data — spanning time periods, geographic locations, and demographic factors — remains difficult.
This project focuses on analyzing city-wide crime data from the year 2020 onwards to detect trends and highlight key patterns. It also aims to develop an interactive dashboard that visually presents these findings, enabling better decision-making, strategic planning, and raising public awareness.
